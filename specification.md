## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 System Architecture
- **Frontend:** 
  - Developed using React.
  - State management using React hooks or Context API.
  - Client-side routing via React Router.
- **Backend:** 
  - FastAPI providing a RESTful API.
  - Asynchronous endpoints to support concurrent requests.
- **Database:** 
  - SQLite for persistent storage during development and small-scale deployments.
  - Consider migration to PostgreSQL/MySQL for production scalability.
- **Deployment:** 
  - Containerized deployment using Docker.
  - Option to deploy on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).

### 3.2 API Endpoints
- **Tasks Management:**
  - `GET /tasks` – Retrieve all tasks.
  - `GET /tasks/{id}` – Retrieve a specific task by its ID.
  - `POST /tasks` – Create a new task.
  - `PUT /tasks/{id}` – Update an existing task.
  - `DELETE /tasks/{id}` – Delete a task.
- **Optional (for future enhancements):**
  - `POST /auth/signup` – User registration.
  - `POST /auth/login` – User authentication.

### 3.3 Database Schema

#### Tasks Table
- `id`: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
- `title`: Text, required
- `description`: Text, optional
- `category`: Text, optional
- `created_at`: Timestamp, defaults to current time
- `updated_at`: Timestamp, auto-updated on modification
- `completed`: Boolean, defaults to false

#### (Optional) Users Table
- `id`: Integer, Primary Key, Auto-increment
- `username`: Text, Unique, required
- `email`: Text, Unique, required
- `password_hash`: Text, required
- `created_at`: Timestamp, defaults to current time

### 3.4 Frontend Implementation Details
- **Project Setup:** 
  - Use Create React App or a similar boilerplate.
- **Component Structure:** 
  - Modular, reusable components (e.g., TaskList, TaskItem, TaskEditor).
  - Styled components or CSS modules for styling to achieve a look similar to Apple Notes.
- **API Communication:** 
  - Utilize Axios or the Fetch API for REST calls.
- **State & Routing:** 
  - Leverage React hooks for state management.
  - Implement React Router for navigating between views (e.g., All Tasks, Categories).

### 3.5 Backend Implementation Details
- **Framework & Libraries:** 
  - FastAPI for the web framework.
  - Uvicorn as the ASGI server.
  - Pydantic for data validation.
  - SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent ORM) for database interactions.
- **Documentation:** 
  - Auto-generated API docs via Swagger UI provided by FastAPI.
- **Error Handling & Logging:** 
  - Consistent error responses.
  - Logging for debugging and monitoring.

### 3.6 Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** 
  - Use Pydantic models to ensure robust data validation.
- **Authentication (Future Scope):** 
  - JWT-based authentication for secure access to protected endpoints.
- **Database Security:** 
  - Employ parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection risks.

### 3.7 Testing & Deployment
- **Testing Strategy:** 
  - Unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
  - Integration tests for API endpoints (using pytest or similar frameworks).
  - End-to-end tests to ensure seamless user experience.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** 
  - Integration with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar tools for continuous integration.
